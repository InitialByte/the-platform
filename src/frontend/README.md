# THE PLATFORM. FRONTEND

Here you should put external modules (packages). It can be developed and maintained by different teams. Those modules may have their own dependencies etc. the_platform is using yarn 2 [workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) and monorepo as main approach.

It allows you to setup multiple packages in such a way that you only need to run yarn install once to install all of them in a single pass.
